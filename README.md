# Hash Map and Hash Set Implementation

This project implements a Hash Map and a Hash Set in JavaScript as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. The Hash Map utilizes a linked list for collision handling, and includes functionalities such as setting, getting, and removing key-value pairs. The Hash Set is similarly implemented using a linked list to manage unique keys. Each data structure has its own Node and LinkedList classes, with the main functionalities executed in separate `index.js` files for the Hash Map and Hash Set.
